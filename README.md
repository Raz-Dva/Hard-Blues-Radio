I created this android app for my Hard Blues Radio Station https://zeno.fm/hardblues/
You can also use the app by modifying it in the hard-Blues-Radio / platforms/android / app/src / main/assets/www/js / index file.js line 35 
src: 'http://stream.zeno.fm/qd8hws5efseuv' (this is my address)
Enter your address to connect your radio
