# Radio Android App 
I created this android app for my Hard Blues Radio Station [Hard Blues Rock](https://zeno.fm/hardblues/)
This application was written using android studio in javascript the main file with the code [index.js](https://github.com/Raz-Dva/Hard-Blues-Radio/blob/master/platforms/android/app/src/main/assets/www/js/index.js)
You can also use the app by modifying it in the [line 35](https://github.com/Raz-Dva/Hard-Blues-Radio/blob/master/platforms/android/app/src/main/assets/www/js/index.js#L35)   src: 'http://stream.zeno.fm/qd8hws5efseuv' (this is my address)    Enter your address to connect your radio.
